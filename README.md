browser_push
============

a small example of browser push with node.js, rabbitMQ, and socket.IO

You'll need to have rabbitMQ installed and running. You'll also need to set up your node_modules directory with your socket.io and amqp libraries.

You can use the node package manager to install these libraries:

curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

npm install socket.io

etc.
