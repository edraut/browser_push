browser_push
============

a small example of browser push with node.js, rabbitMQ, and socket.IO

You'll need to have rabbitMQ installed and running. You'll need the socket.io and amqp libraries.

You can use the node package manager to install these libraries:

curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

npm install socket.io

etc.
